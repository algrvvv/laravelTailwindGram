# TailwindGram
A small forum written in Laravel, the styles of which, based on the name, are made with a Tailwind.

>**A comment system is provided on the post page, but only if the user has logged into his account**

## Authors page

>Here are the authors, the number of their posts and the total number of views

>**It is worth noting that in order to publish a post and, accordingly, display the author on this page, it is necessary that the admin approves your post**

A simple admin panel was made independently on this forum
<!-- ![Alt text](/screenshots/adminpanel.png?raw=true "Optional Title") -->

After logging in to the admin panel, we display articles that are awaiting approval or rejection

>After approval, your post will be posted. It will be possible to find among others by the title or some words of your post itself

Clicking on the author's name will take you to the author's profile page where all his articles will be displayed. In addition, it is made, maybe not the best, but still a system for counting views. It is possible to register on the forum and add your posts or comments
